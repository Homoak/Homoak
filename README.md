üëã Hello, World!

My name is Homoak, and I specialize in backend development using Python with the Flask framework. I am from Mariupol, Ukraine, and I have been developing my programming skills since 2024. My goal is to create efficient and reliable web applications using modern technologies and approaches.

üîß Skills and Technologies I Work With
Programming Languages:

Python (my primary language, mainly used for server-side logic, working with databases, and APIs)
JavaScript (basic knowledge for frontend development, adding interactivity to pages)
Go (basic knowledge, interested in learning for building high-performance systems)
Database Development:

SQLite (lightweight database for small projects and testing)
PostgreSQL (powerful relational database for larger, scalable systems)
Backend Development:

Flask (my main framework for building server-side applications and RESTful APIs)
Frontend Development:

HTML5 (core structure for web pages)
CSS (styling and creating responsive layouts for web applications)
API Development:

Aiogram (building Telegram bots using APIs)
üå± What I‚Äôm Learning
I am constantly expanding my knowledge in web development and improving my skills by working on new projects. Currently, I‚Äôm focused on the following areas:

Advanced Flask Techniques: Learning additional functionalities such as authentication extensions, request handling, and database integration.
Frontend Frameworks: Interested in learning Angular and other modern technologies for building interactive web applications.
Modern Web Development Practices: Deepening my understanding of RESTful API principles, asynchronous programming, and web application performance optimization.
üéØ My Goals
Continue to study and improve my skills in web development, particularly backend development.
Contribute to open-source projects and work on large-scale commercial projects.
Develop innovative and useful web applications that solve real-world problems.
Learn the basics of languages like C++, C#, PHP to broaden my programming capabilities.
Improve my JavaScript and Go knowledge to become a full-stack developer.
üíª My Projects
In this repositorys, you will find various examples of my projects using Flask. Each project contains code samples for building web applications, developing RESTful APIs, and integrating with databases. I constantly update my repositories by adding new examples and improving existing ones.

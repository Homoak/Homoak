üëã Hello, World!

My name is Homoak, and I specialize in backend development using Python with the Flask framework. I am from Mariupol, Ukraine, and I have been developing my programming skills since 2024. My goal is to create efficient and reliable web applications using modern technologies and approaches.

üîß Skills and Technologies I Work With
Programming Languages:

1.Python (my primary language, mainly used for server-side logic, working with databases, and APIs)
JavaScript (basic knowledge for frontend development, adding interactivity to pages)
Go (basic knowledge, interested in learning for building high-performance systems)
Database Development:

2.SQLite (lightweight database for small projects and testing)
PostgreSQL (powerful relational database for larger, scalable systems)
Backend Development:

3.Flask (my main framework for building server-side applications and RESTful APIs)
Frontend Development:

4.HTML5 (core structure for web pages)
CSS (styling and creating responsive layouts for web applications)
API Development:

5.Aiogram (building Telegram bots using APIs)

üå± What I‚Äôm Learning:

I am constantly expanding my knowledge in web development and improving my skills by working on new projects. Currently, I‚Äôm focused on the following areas:

Advanced Flask Techniques: Learning additional functionalities such as authentication extensions, request handling, and database integration.
Frontend Frameworks: Interested in learning Angular and other modern technologies for building interactive web applications.
Modern Web Development Practices: Deepening my understanding of RESTful API principles, asynchronous programming, and web application performance optimization.

üéØ My Goals:

1.Continue to study and improve my skills in web development, particularly backend development.
2.Contribute to open-source projects and work on large-scale commercial projects.
3.Develop innovative and useful web applications that solve real-world problems.
4.Learn the basics of languages like C++, Go, JavaScripy to broaden my programming capabilities.
5.Improve my JavaScript and Go knowledge to become a full-stack developer.

üíª My Projects:

In this repositorys, you will find various examples of my projects using Flask. Each project contains code samples for building web applications, developing RESTful APIs, and integrating with databases. I constantly update my repositories by adding new examples and improving existing ones.
